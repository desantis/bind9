DESCRIPTION
===========

``dnssec-importkey`` reads a public DNSKEY record and generates a pair
of .key/.private files. The DNSKEY record may be read from an existing
.key file, in which case a corresponding .private file will be
generated, or it may be read from any other file or from the standard
input, in which case both .key and .private files will be generated.

The newly-created .private file does *not* contain private key data, and
cannot be used for signing. However, having a .private file makes it
possible to set publication (``-P``) and deletion (``-D``) times for the
key, which means the public key can be added to and removed from the
DNSKEY RRset on schedule even if the true private key is stored offline.

OPTIONS
=======

-f filename
   Zone file mode: instead of a public keyfile name, the argument is the
   DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from
   ``file``. If the domain name is the same as ``file``, then it may be
   omitted.

   If ``file`` is set to ``"-"``, then the zone data is read from the
   standard input.

-K directory
   Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.

-L ttl
   Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
   DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that
   will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
   place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. Setting
   the default TTL to ``0`` or ``none`` removes it.

-h
   Emit usage message and exit.

-v level
   Sets the debugging level.

-V
   Prints version information.

TIMING OPTIONS
==============

Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
argument begins with a '+' or '-', it is interpreted as an offset from
the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the offset is
computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To
explicitly prevent a date from being set, use 'none' or 'never'.

-P date/offset
   Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
   that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used
   to sign it.

-P sync date/offset
   Sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key
   are to be published to the zone.

-D date/offset
   Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
   key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key
   repository, however.)

-D sync date/offset
   Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this
   key are to be deleted.

FILES
=====

A keyfile can be designed by the key identification ``Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii``
or the full file name ``Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key`` as generated by
dnssec-keygen8.
